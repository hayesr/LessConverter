# LessConverter

LessConverter is an abstracted converter to transform Less CSS into SCSS, extracted from project-specific converters like those found in `bootstrap-sass` and `patternfly-sass`. Originally intended for Patternfly and Angular Patternfly but with the goal of being a general purpose converter for any project.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

$ gem install less_converter

## Usage

TODO: Write usage instructions here

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
